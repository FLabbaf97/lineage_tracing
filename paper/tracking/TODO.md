I'd shift this last part (", and the performance...") to a new sentence that can be placed towards the end of the manuscript where you say that your method works well for large time differences while the accuracy of the classical algorithms drops quickly as time between the frames increases


Nicole : disagree, this provides valuable context to the problem. I can repeat this in the conclusion though

I've never observed that the cell geometry changes due to pressure of the other cells. Can you point to an example from the movie or remove if it's not happening?

Nicole : add the figure of that weird cell that gets pushed around

Nature methods paper which uses a FFT

How did you find this value?


This is roughly in accordance with our previous measurement of cell area (14 um^2), but just to make sure there are no mistakes: you used the scaling factor of 0.111 um/px?

Nicole : Yes I used 1/9.2308 ~= 0.108 um/px

1. Can you normalize the histograms to max_height =1 or total_area=1?

Nicole : I previously had normalized them, but you asked me to add yticks. I think yticks are only informative when they refer to a true count, normalized yticks do not convay information.
